# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of various **Machine Learning (ML) projects** that showcase different techniques and algorithms in the field of machine learning. Each project is implemented in Python, using popular libraries such as **Scikit-learn**, **TensorFlow**, **Keras**, and **Pandas**.

The goal of this repository is to provide hands-on examples of solving real-world problems using machine learning, as well as to showcase different types of models and evaluation techniques.

## Projects

Each project is organized in its own folder and includes:
- **A Jupyter notebook** (`.ipynb`) that demonstrates the implementation of the machine learning model.
- **A README file** that explains the problem, dataset, methodology, and results.
- **Required dependencies** listed in a `requirements.txt` file for easy installation.
- **Dataset**: The dataset used for the project (in `.csv`, `.xlsx`, or other formats), included in the project folder or linked to an external source.


### Current Projects:
1. **Iris Flower Classification**: Classifying iris flowers into three species using **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** and hyperparameter tuning with **GridSearchCV**.

### Features
- **Variety of Algorithms**: Projects demonstrate both **supervised** and **unsupervised** learning algorithms, such as **SVM**, **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, **KNN**, and **Neural Networks**.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Examples of data cleaning, feature selection, and scaling for effective model performance.
- **Model Evaluation**: Each project includes detailed evaluation using metrics like **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**, and techniques like **cross-validation** and **hyperparameter tuning**.
